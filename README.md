# Operaton Developer Training Exercises

> [🇩🇪 Deutsch](README.de.md) · 🇬🇧 **English**

Hands-on exercises for the Operaton Developer Training. The project implements the Miravelo Inner Circle membership process with Operaton as the process engine and a hexagonal architecture that decouples business logic from infrastructure.

## Exercises

### Background: Miravelo

**Miravelo** is an online shop for premium bicycles — gravel bikes for long
weekend tours, road bikes for everyone who likes going fast on the asphalt. Its customers
are young, brand-conscious, and pretty passionate.

The shop is growing, and new products keep arriving. The team decides:
let's build a **newsletter** so customers stay informed about product launches and
exclusive offers. Someone signs up, gets a welcome mail — done.

> *"Surely that's built in an hour."*
> — Every developer who has ever underestimated a newsletter.

The training takes place in the context of the exclusive **Miravelo Inner Circle** — a membership
limited to a thousand seats for the most loyal customers. You first model the whole target process
at the business level, then automate it step by step.

What follows is a journey through increasingly complex BPMN patterns: gateways, boundary events,
subprocesses, parallel gateways, call activities, DMN decision tables, and compensation —
each exercise builds on the previous one.

| Exercise | Topic | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [0](docs/en/exercise-00.md) | Business-level BPMN modeling | Model the complete Inner Circle membership process at the business level — the shared target for the whole training |
| [1](docs/en/exercise-01.md) | Getting the engine running | Run the given start-form / Manual-Task model end-to-end, get to know the Cockpit, the engine's `act_*` tables, and EnterpriseGlue The Bridge |
| [2](docs/en/exercise-02.md) | The first wait state | Turn the "Confirm" Manual Task into a User Task and give it a self-made Generated Form |
| [3](docs/en/exercise-03.md) | Automate a step | Turn the "Send welcome mail" Manual Task into a Service Task backed by a JavaDelegate (Cockpit-started) |
| [4](docs/en/exercise-04.md) | The application takes over | Message start event, REST register + confirm endpoints, message correlation, persistence |
| [5](docs/en/exercise-05.md) | Capacity check with a gateway | Exclusive gateway, transaction boundaries, business key, task form |
| [6](docs/en/exercise-06.md) | Process tests | Process unit test with an in-memory engine, mocked use cases, without PostgreSQL |
| [6 · Add-on](docs/en/exercise-06-addon.md) | bpmn-to-code | Element IDs as generated constants instead of hand-typed strings |

> The structure, language, and quality criteria of the exercises are captured in

> exercises are cross-checked with the `aufgaben-review` skill

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL, MailHog and EnterpriseGlue The Bridge
cd stack && docker-compose up -d

# Build everything
./mvnw clean install

# Start the process-application module (the one module where you work on all exercises)
cd services/process-application && ../../mvnw spring-boot:run

# Operaton Cockpit
open http://localhost:8080/operaton/app/cockpit/    # admin / admin

# EnterpriseGlue The Bridge (additional UI)
open http://localhost:8081                          # admin@enterpriseglue.com / adminadmin
```

### Loading an exercise solution

The `process-application` module starts in the state of **Exercise 1** (engine still commented out). If you
can't fully finish an exercise, you can copy the reference solution into your `process-application` module
and continue working with it:

```bash
# Copy solutions/exercise-02 into the process-application module (valid values: 01–10, two-digit)
./mvnw -pl services/process-application antrun:run@load-solution -Dsolution=02
```

The task replaces `src/main` completely (Java, `application.yaml`, BPMN/DMN); `src/test` stays
untouched. All modules – the `process-application` module **and** all solutions – run on the same port
(`8080`) and the same DB schema (`exercise`); so only **one** module runs at a time.
The Operaton dependencies activated in **Exercise 1** (`pom.xml`) remain in place – so only load
a solution from `exercise-2` onward after Exercise 1 is complete.

## Technology stack

| Component | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Java 21 |
| Framework | Spring Boot 4 |
| Process Engine | Operaton 2.1.3 |
| Database | PostgreSQL (JPA / Hibernate) |
| Build | Maven |
| Architecture tests | ArchUnit |
| Process UIs | Operaton Cockpit + EnterpriseGlue The Bridge |

## Operaton

[Operaton](https://operaton.org) is a community-driven, Apache-2.0 fork of Camunda 7. It offers full compatibility with the Camunda 7 API and is developed further independently as open source.

In this project, Operaton runs embedded in Spring Boot, provides the classic web applications (Cockpit, Tasklist, Admin) at `http://localhost:8080/operaton/app/cockpit/`, and handles the BPMN process execution for the Inner Circle membership process.

As an **additional UI**, [EnterpriseGlue The Bridge](https://github.com/EnterpriseGlue/enterpriseglue-the-bridge-oss) — an open-source portal to design, deploy and manage BPMN/DMN processes — runs alongside the stack at `http://localhost:8081`. It connects to the same engine REST API (`/engine-rest`) that the Cockpit uses; you set it up in Exercise 1.

Service tasks are wired up via the `JavaDelegate` pattern with `DelegateExpression`:

```java
@Component
public class SendWelcomeMailDelegate extends BaseDelegate {

    private final SendWelcomeMailUseCase useCase;

    public SendWelcomeMailDelegate(SendWelcomeMailUseCase useCase) {
        this.useCase = useCase;
    }

    @Override
    protected void executeTask(DelegateExecution execution) {
        var subscriptionId = (String) execution.getVariable("subscriptionId");
        useCase.sendWelcomeMail(new SubscriptionId(UUID.fromString(subscriptionId)));
    }
}
```

## Architecture

The project follows a **hexagonal architecture** (ports & adapters):

```
REST / JavaDelegates           Application              Operaton / Database
  (Inbound adapters)   →   Ports + Services   →     (Outbound adapters)
                               ↑
                            Domain
                        (engine-neutral)
```

Architecture rules are enforced at build time via [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/) tests.
